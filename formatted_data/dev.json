At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework.

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. Our point is “Executioner's suffering”. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

The second point is “Social experience”. I will explain the first point “Feeling importance of money”. We believe that a part-time job is a good opportunity to feel importance of money. When we live, money is necessary. However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview. From those whole experiences, students learn the importance of money. It leads to notice the importance of time and studying at the end of the day. That’s why the experience of having part-time job is meaningful. Thank you.",

However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. Our point is “Executioner's suffering”. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

The second point is “Social experience”. I will explain the first point “Feeling importance of money”. We believe that a part-time job is a good opportunity to feel importance of money. When we live, money is necessary. However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview. From those whole experiences, students learn the importance of money. It leads to notice the importance of time and studying at the end of the day. That’s why the experience of having part-time job is meaningful. Thank you.",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

Our point is that homework has harmful efforts on the educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study.

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. Our point is “Executioner's suffering”. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room.

Our point is that homework has harmful efforts on the educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly believe homework should be abolished. ",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

Our point is that homework has harmful efforts on the educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly believe homework should be abolished. ",

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

        "pm_speech": "Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “High school students should have a part-time job”. First, we are going to talk about Japan. We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands.

Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students.

The second point is “Social experience”. I will explain the first point “Feeling importance of money”. We believe that a part-time job is a good opportunity to feel importance of money. When we live, money is necessary. However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview. From those whole experiences, students learn the importance of money. It leads to notice the importance of time and studying at the end of the day. That’s why the experience of having part-time job is meaningful. Thank you.",

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. Our point is “Executioner's suffering”. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly believe homework should be abolished. ",

However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview.

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects.

We define that the death penalty should be abolished and instead of the death penalty, we propose that the suspected are sentence to life in. Our point is “Executioner's suffering”. In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly believe homework should be abolished. ",

Our point is that forcing students to do homework will make them passive in character, rather than active. Some people may think that students should be given homework so that they can learn what to do. However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

The second point is “Social experience”. I will explain the first point “Feeling importance of money”. We believe that a part-time job is a good opportunity to feel importance of money. When we live, money is necessary. However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview. From those whole experiences, students learn the importance of money. It leads to notice the importance of time and studying at the end of the day. That’s why the experience of having part-time job is meaningful. Thank you.",

The second point is “Social experience”. I will explain the first point “Feeling importance of money”. We believe that a part-time job is a good opportunity to feel importance of money. When we live, money is necessary. However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview. From those whole experiences, students learn the importance of money. It leads to notice the importance of time and studying at the end of the day. That’s why the experience of having part-time job is meaningful. Thank you.",

Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands. Executers’ stress is extremely overwhelming. That’s why the death penalty should be abolished.",

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

However, this is harmful to students because a school is not a place where students only learn to study. It is also where they learn how to live and manage their own lives. Once they graduate from school and start a career, they no longer have a “teacher” who will always take care of them and manage what they need to do. Students will have to think about what they need to do by themselves. If students are always given homework, they will always be waiting for instructions and guidelines from teachers and cannot think about what they need to do by themselves.

In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

        "pm_speech": "Hello everyone. Today’s topic is “High school students should have a part-time job”. First, we are going to talk about Japan. We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students.

When we live, money is necessary. However, as long as a student is financially supported by a family or orphanage, he/she doesn’t understand how much money is actually necessary for living and how hard it is to earn the money. By doing part-time job, he/she will understand the reality of earning money. That means not only the experience of working and getting money, but also the process to get a part-time job such as preparing CV, bank account and having an interview. From those whole experiences, students learn the importance of money. It leads to notice the importance of time and studying at the end of the day. That’s why the experience of having part-time job is meaningful. Thank you.",
