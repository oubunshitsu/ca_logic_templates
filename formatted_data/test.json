    "pm_speech": "Today’s topic is “whether the death penalty should be abolished”. We believe it should be abolished. Our point is that misjudgment in the death penalty is very dangerous. Humans make mistakes. This is the nature of a human and we cannot deny it completely. Of course, technology has been developed such as DNA testing, surveillance camera, and so on. However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society. Remember, even if we carefully investigate the incident, there is always a risk of mistakes. For these reasons, death penalty should be abolished.",

      "If the DNA evidence and other evidence is strong then the death penalty should be an option that needs to be considered.",
      "This way the person who committed the crime will not be able to harm anyone else ever again."

In present situations, a person who executes the death penalty for a criminal whose death penalty has been confirmed by a trial suffers a lot. Some methods of the death penalty include hanging and using gas chambers. Let me illustrate the case of hanging in Japan. A prisoner does not know when they will be executed until the day of execution. At the day of execution, they first enter the teacher’s room and write a farewell letter. Then, they go to the antechamber for execution and are separated from the execution room by a curtain. The convict on death row is blindfolded and handcuffed, and a curtain is closed to the execution room. Finally, they go to the execution room. A rope is hung around their neck and they stand on a tread plate marked in the center of the room. Then, multiple prison officers push the button to open and close the tread, and the convict on death row falls. Those executioners feel strong stress. They don’t know which button is actually connected to the input of the tread. They feel that they are responsible themselves for killing the suspect on death row by their own hands.

The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students.

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects.

However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable.

Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

Our point is that homework has harmful efforts on the educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study.

I have two arguments to make: First, with a part-time job, students can learn what they otherwise cannot at school. Second, part-time jobs teach students the importance of money. The first point is that, through a part-time job, students can learn what they cannot at school such as responsibility and manners. For instance, a student working at a convenience store may be responsible for using the money of the store. Moreover, as a staff of the store, he or she needs to learn some manners. These are what a student cannot learn at school. A school is a small community, and students will only interact with their friends or teachers. In such a small community, they will not be able to learn important things such as the responsibility and manners as an adult. Therefore, doing a part-time job is beneficial for students. For those reasons, high school students should have a part-time job.",

      "Working a part-time job students have less time to spend with their friends who are in your accommodation or on your course.",

I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school.

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",

However, still there is still a possibility of misjudgment. If misjudgment happens when the court sentences the suspected criminal the death penalty, it will be irreparable. When we deprive the life of a suspected criminal, they will never be able to live again. It’s very terrible. Imagine the case where your family member is mistakenly arrested by the police and unfortunately suspected to be sentenced to the death penalty. Would you be able to endure this situation? The answer is definitely “No”. Therefore, at least, by abolishing death penalty, we can prevent the situation of ending the life of innocent people. At least, we will have more time to investigate the truth when the innocent in jail are suspected of a serious crime. Then, there will be a greater chance that the innocent, suspected person can be saved in the future from losing their life. It’s much safer society.

In my case, I go to tennis club after class until 5:00 pm and then I go to cram school until 8:00 pm. After this full day, I arrive at my home around 8:40 pm to eat dinner and take a shower. At nearly 10:00 pm I start my homework. I have a lot of homework. As a result, I go to bed late at night at nearly 1:00 am in the morning and I don’t have the opportunity to sleep for a long period of time. It is not healthy. Therefore, homework should be abolished.",

      "Doing away with homework because students have a habit of procrastinating just reinforces a bad habit that will cause problems in school and beyond.",

      "In this sense, assigning homework teaches an important life skill: how to put important tasks first instead of putting them off until it's too late."

Our point is that homework has harmful efforts on the educational development of school students. Some students have memorized the incorrect way to study with homework. I’ll give you some examples. In high school, students have lots of things to do, like hobbies, club activities, part-time jobs and so on. So how do students who have little time to do homework deal with it? Some of them do homework during class, which is inefficient not only with regard to the homework but also to the class. In a worst-case scenario, they copy it from their classmates. Of course, it means that they would learn nothing. But they receive a passing score as long as they finish homework without understanding how to properly study. Who thinks homework works adequately in these situations? We should abolish homework in order to let students understand the right and wrong ways to study. For all these reasons, we strongly believe homework should be abolished. ",
    "lo_speech": [
      "They said that students get a passing score if they finish homework even when they copy another's work, so homework should be abolished.",
      "However, abolishing homework because some students cheat is unwise because it ends up depriving all students of the academic and other benefits of homework because of the bad choices of some.",
      "Moreover, students who cheat by plagiarizing work need to learn a lesson.",
      "Simply doing away with homework deprives these students of the chance to learn that lesson and actually rewards them for cheating.",
      "In addition, it is a bit naive to think that teachers can't discern when students have copied their work from a classmate or other source.",
      "So, students who consistently cheat by copying work are unlikely to get a passing score consistently in reality."

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects.

We have two points: The first point is why high school students will improve academic abilities. The second point is why the high school students will become more responsible. I will explain the first point. We believe that a part-time job can allow a student to connect what they learn in school with what they can experience in society. As a result, the students can realize how significant and necessary it is to learn in school and therefore be motivated to learn more. But if they don’t have part-time jobs, they study academic subjects without feeling any necessity to learn because they have no deep experience in a real world social environment where they can apply that knowledge. For example, in English classes, students merely memorize many different words and grammatical items because they don’t feel it necessary to use this knowledge of language in a real life environment. Thus, we need to build a bridge between what students learn in school and reality. Suppose high school students worked at a convenience store. They would see many immigrant workers and they would talk with many of them in English. Those real experiences can give them the motivation to utilize English classes more in school. This is very important because a part-time job is the only way for high school students to experience what is occurring in society and why they need to learn academic subjects. For these reasons, high school students should have a part-time job. Thank you.",
